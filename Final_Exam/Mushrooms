            <hr>
                <p>Here at Beautiful Waterfalls Of The World, we delight in the nature around us. We believe in taking at least 15 minutes a day to meditate and/or experience nature.
                     We know life is busy, but taking the time to center yourself, keeps you steady.
                     The mind is a powerful tool. Maintenance keeps your instrument in order. Some say they don't know how to let go, never fear it is easy with practice.
                     All you have to do is not actively think. Well what does that mean?...I'll tell you. 
                     It means when thoughts come barging in on you, you let them pass through. That means not following the thought. It also means not trying to stop and/or direct thoughts.
                     No need to react or judge just let your thoughts flow through you, like water through your fingers.
                     Now of course it is very helpful if your flowing thoughts are pleasent, if not that should be your first step. Remember the boy that never grew up, "Think Happy Thoughts". Actively try to feel good throughout your day. Good thoughts add up.</p>

                <p>What is a Mushroom? Mushrooms are the reproductive structure produced by some fungi. While they are living organisms, they are very different from other living things like plants and animals.
                    Mushrooms have great health benefits. They are easy to forage, or buy. Buying them from a reputable source is the safest way to obtain them.</p>
