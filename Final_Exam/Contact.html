                <p>What is a Mushroom? Mushrooms are the reproductive structure produced by some fungi. While they are living organisms, they are very different from other living things like plants and animals.
                    Mushrooms have great health benefits. They are easy to forage, or buy. Buying them from a reputable source is the safest way to obtain them.</p>
