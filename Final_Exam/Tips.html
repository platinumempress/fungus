                <li>Tips for Buying
                    When buying fresh mushrooms, chose ones that are firm, dry, and unbruised. Avoid mushrooms that appear slimy or withered.</li>
                <li>Tips for Storage
                    Store mushrooms in the refrigerator. Mushrooms should not be washed or trimmed until it is time to cook them.</li> 
                <li>Tips for Cooking
                <p>To preserve the most nutrients it is recomended to prepare mushrooms on the grill or in the microwave for 1-3 minutes, give or take a minute, depending on the variety. 
                     The Environmental Working Group, which assesses foods for their pesticide contents, placed mushrooms that grow in the U.S. in its 2019 list of the 15 cleanest foods, 
                     referring to relatively low traces of pesticides. However, people should still wash and clean them carefully before using them to remove any soil and grit. If necessary,
                     trim the ends of the stalks. Some wild mushrooms also contain high levels of heavy metals and other harmful chemicals. To avoid these dangers, only consume mushrooms 
                     from a reliable source.</p></li>
